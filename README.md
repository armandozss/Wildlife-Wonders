This repository showcases two projects created using HTML and CSS, which I developed to enhance my skills during my programming class at school.

My first project focuses on foxes, my favorite animal. I researched and simplify information about them and presented it in an engaging web format.

For my second project, I chose pandas due to their intriguing nature. I digged into details such as their taxonomy, etymology, subspecies, and other interesting facts, all sourced from wikipedia.

These projects demonstrate my progression in HTML and CSS. The foxes project was my initial effort, where I followed the 5 stages of ALM (application lifecycle management): planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Through valuable lessons that I learned from errors in my first project, I refined my skills in both programming and ALM for the development of my second project.

-All information displayed between the two pages doesn't belong to me and I give credits to each webpage that did the research-
