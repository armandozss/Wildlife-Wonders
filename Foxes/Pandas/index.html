      <h1>Giant Pandas</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="a-text">
      <p>The giant panda (<strong>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</strong>), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "<strong>giant panda</strong>" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda" target="_blank">red panda</a>, a neighboring musteloid. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.</p>

      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="b-text">
      <p>Pandas shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons, this is why their precise taxonomic was under debate.However in 1985, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family <strong>Ursidae</strong>. <br> These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor of the<strong>Ursidae</strong>; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.</p>

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="b-text">
      <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.The closest candidate is the Nepali word <strong>ponya</strong>, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name "<strong>panda</strong>" or "<strong>common panda</strong>" refers to the red panda (<strong>Ailurus fulgens</strong>), which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as a panda.</p>

      <h3>Subspecies</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="c-text">
      <p>Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c-list">
      <ul>
        <div class="ca-text">
          <li><strong>A. m. melanoleuca</strong>: The nominate subspecies, consists of most extant populations of the giant panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colours.

        <div class="ca-text">
          <li><strong>A. m. qinlingensis</strong>: The Qinling panda, is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1,300–3,000 m (4,300–9,800 ft).<br> The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a light brown and white pattern.The skull of A. m. qinlingensis is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.
